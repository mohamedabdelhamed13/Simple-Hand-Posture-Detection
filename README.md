# Simple-Hand-Posture-Detection
Write a complete program (using any programming language) to apply edge detection. In doing as:
### Step 1: Input Images:
A. The dataset consists of more than one image; each image has a different hand sign.
B. The user takes a picture of the hand to be tested either through the real-time or loaded image.
### Step 2: Image Pre-processing
A. The image is converted into grayscale 
B. Enhancement image using Filters technique (Smoothing filter, sharping filter, smooth then sharp, sharp then smoothed, other) 
C. Convert the grayscale image into a binary image. 
### Step3: Segmentation image from the background (how?) 
### Step 4: Detect the border of the hand image 
a. Apply the following filter (Sobel, Prewitt, and canny), and which one is better?
b. How did canny thin the edge? 
C. How canny edgy detectors remove unimportant edges or weak edges. 
### Step 5: display one image containing the original image, the gray image, and the edge image.
